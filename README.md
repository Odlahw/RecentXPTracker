# RecentXPTracker

5 Most recent kills tracked for TWoW

Will always track EXP and names of 5 most recent kills that awarded xp

Toggle to not display after every kill in chat by using /xpcheck off

Toggle back on to display after every kill /xpcheck on

Can create a macro to use /xpcheck to just have it toggled off and a button to hit when you maybe didnt see or are just curious.
Enjoy
